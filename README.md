# Domore

_domore is a collaborative network of experts_

Enabled by simple tools and incentivised with crypto tokens our community is building an open and bottom up network of talent that can outperform large global consultancies and agencies. We're on a mission to redesign how talent works together to sell and create value in order to bring great work to as many people as possible.

domore allows individuals and small teams who already sell expertise to clients to scale that up within a partner network. This is made possible by rewarding those who build and grow the network with a share of network tokens that represent future network earnings.

### Why?

Why create domore...?

Alex, Jez, and I have spent the last 6 (7?) years working together to build technology companies. This pursuit has been bootstrapped by working with clients to help them research, design, and build product companies. We explored scaling up our consulting business, but found the incentives and economics of the model to be misaligned with both producing great outcomes for clients and allowing talent to do great work.

We decided to move forward by building a network of top freelancers and other small teams to collaborate with on projects. Having done this for a few years on projects ranging from 1 day a week of one of our time to 8 people on a project spanning 6 months we became frustrated by the limitation of only working on a project by project basis with other talent...

* **Not enough incentive to invest in building client relationships** Outside of delivering client outcomes and being paid for one's time talent isn't incentivised to invest in the brand and relationship building work that compounds over time to benefit large consultancies and agencies. Experts tend to have a very transactional mindset around a single project and client. Talent incentivised to take demand off others and very little incentive to bring demand to others.
* **Greater vetted talent liquidity required to meet time sensitive demand** Our limited network meant that although we knew a lot of great talent that we would be happy to work with on projects it often fell short at the time and place when talent was needed on a project. Our partners also had talent they could pull in but they had little incentive to do this when they we're busy as it would take time and effort on their part to reach out to their network each time we had an opportunity for work.
* **Not enough ROI in selling other people's time** The work involved in pitching a client and winning a project is more than nominal, which combined with the risk of time investment not bearing fruit means that it needs to be adequately rewarded. Talent working on a project basis have high day rates and clients aren't very keen on paying much higher rates, so the earnings on other's time is smaller than it would be if used permanent talent within an agency or consultancy.
* **Agreements and payment collection require collective action** We often ended up taking on too much of the risk in a project if we acted as the middleman between talent and clients. More recently we have simply made introductions to allow agreements and payments to be direct, but found neither to be great outcomes as the former put too much risk on us and the latter often resulted in a poor experience for talent and clients.
* **Larger clients work via large agencies as they can service broader set of needs** Larger clients want to know talent is capable of delivering larger projects, which is why many senior experts tend to work as subcontractors for larger agencies when working with large clients as their small operation doesn't seem capable of taking on larger projects.

If the above issues sounds familiar, you might like domore.

Which brings me to how domore has developed in pursuit of solving all of that...

### Approach

domore tries to solve the question of "[Why?](#why)" with a few tools to enable and incentivise:

1. **Collaborative proposal tool** Allowing talent to work together in putting together proposals of different types with ability to create breakdowns for time and costs.
2. **Simple time and expense tracking** Each member on a project can log time and expenses onto a project to ensure the correct amount is recorded when it comes time to invoice clients.
3. **Standardised agreements** All talent involved in project are able to agree on project terms with clients. We've seen first hand the benefits of partnering and agreeing directly with clients over having client owning experts bear the admin and risk.
4. **Single invoice for clients** We wanted to make it as easy for clients to process and pay our network as it is to pay agencies and so we've made it so a single invoice can be created and payment can be distributed to all involved based on pre-agreed terms.
5. **Cryto tokens used to incentivise ongoing investment in network client building** Even once we have the above tools to make working together with talent outside of a single firm we need to incentivise the building of a network of both clients and talent. This is a challenging thing to get right as distribution of earnings need to incentivise partners to invest their efforts with belief in ROI from future network earnings. We will address this in much greater detail in our whitepaper.
6. **Open network built by incentivised partners make finding vetted talent when needed easier** We will also then make it easy for partners in the network to discover one another and make it so partners work together to build enough density to keep talent engaged. This will mean that the network will grow and increase the chance of having vetted partners when needed.
7. [**RESEARCH**] **Speeding up applicable learning** We've seen first hand and with the talent we've had the priviledge of working with that they tend to do a large percentage of their learning by taking on projects that will force them to learn and grow in order to deliver. We're hoping to find ways to enable this to happen within our network in order to unlock what we believe is the best educational resource that exists today.
8. [**RESEARCH**] **Empowering talent to own their careers** We hope to build a network that empowers what we have seen among the top talent around us. They develop their expertise and manage their career like a portfolio of investments. We believe that this network once at scale will give talent greater optionality to do this to a greater extent and thus allow us to work with organisations with a focus on delivering business value over traditional employer and employee relationships.
